Audio-to-Text Transcription using Wav2Vec2
This project demonstrates the use of the Wav2Vec2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to transcribe speech from an audio file into text.
This project is using a ready-made AI model called facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h. Itâ€™s good for English but might not work well for other languages.
The AI model is part of the Hugging Face Transformers Library.
It also uses Librosa to handle audio and PyTorch for running the AI.
